# Salesforce-Project
My Salesforce project, "To Supply Leftover Food to the Poor," builds an efficient system to manage and distribute surplus food to poor. It coordinates venues, volunteers, and delivery points using Custom Objects, Flows, Reports, and Dashboards for smooth operations and tracking.
